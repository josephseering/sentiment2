      "I agree with the sentiment of the writer but disapprove of the condescending tone of the entry. Immigration has a legal procedure which should not be put aside. Legal immigrants are wonderful for the country because not only do they help improve our economy, they also pay taxes which helps in maintaining the well-being of our country and of course, the people. On the other hand, we have ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. These are people who didn't care about the legal procedure of entering America and they are willing to take extremely low paying jobs because they cannot legally work without proper legal documentation or work permits. This means that illegal immigrants are taking away (dey took'err jerrbs!) jobs from legal residents of the country. Instead of the US citizen or the legal immigrant who could've used the job to earn money for their business or to raise a family, the illegal immigrant tooks their job for lower pay. Legal immigrants and citizens pay taxes. Illegal immigrants don't. This means that not only did they take people's jobs, they also took money that should have gone for the betterment of the country. It is also common that illegal immigrants are involved in crimes such as drug distribution, burglary, rape, murder and other bad things. Since they have no legal records, it is a lot harder to track them down whenever to commit these crimes. I think that we need to look into this issue rationally. Forget what \"group\" you are a part of. Republican, Democran, Liberal, Conservative, that doesn't matter. Ask yourself this question. Is it alright for people to break the law to enter this country, take jobs that they are not legally allowed to accept, not pay taxes, and then potentially commit all sorts of other crimes (aside from illegally entering the country), all the while other people are working hard and spending lots of money to get approved to become legal immigrants and are very willing to pay taxes from the money they will earn from jobs to benefit both the country and its citizens? Calling people stupid and accusing anyone who does not share your opinion racist (or whatever bad term) does not benefit the converstation at all. Focus on the subject and state your thoughts rationally.\n",

Germany is not an underprivileged country, riddled by turf wars and rampant government corruption, it is much easier to wait for legal immigrant status when you are not worrying about your life and feeding your family.

It is thanks to the Supreme Court, not Barack Obama himself, that gays have the right to marry - Dems never pused for this actively. Also NAFTA (again under Clinton) is largely responsible for making economic conditions unbearable in Mexico, which is why the border and illegal immigration is such a problem in the US (as well as US corporations actively recruiting Mexicans to come into the country to work for pennies and get deported in the end). Nothing was done to fix the immigration problem while Democrats were in power!

It only takes a handful of snowflakes to make a snowball, and everybody hides from those. You can't have blizzards without snowflakes - and they have been known to shut down cities, even states, for days at a time with the havoc they wreak.

Note that that may not be true for all voters, and that the alt-right does exist, but to suggest that Trump motivated them en masse is ludicrous. People want a change in Washington.

And, I canâ€™t help but taking this as veiled white supremacists talk. As a white sheâ€™s clearly criticizing the immigration system where it benefits people of color, most likely Hispanics. Likely, being white, she faced none of the barriers to entry that will likely be erected against people of color during the current administration. And she has some degree of learning to do about how the United States federal government functions, as none of her suggested proposals a viable merely by a President, even though the effort maybe be there with respect to immigrants of color.\n",
